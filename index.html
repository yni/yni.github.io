        <p>Welcome to the first edition of my opening hand calculator.</p>

        <script src="calculate.js">
        </script>

        <p>I'm hoping this develops into an elaborate project with the following functionalities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Allow users to input multiple cards that represent a deck.</li>
            <li>2. Perform hand probability calculations using my own algorithm based around integer composition and combinations. This means no simulations or approximations.</li>
            <li>3. Show a graphical representation of the results.</li>
            <li>4. Compare results between a current run vs. a previous run. Allow user to revert to a previous run.</li> 
            <li>5. Allow users to input a 2-card combination table of live vs. brick hands.</li>
            <li>6. Allow further categorization of the live hands by tiers.</li>
            <li>7. Support 3-card hands.</li>
            <li>8. Allow drag and drop to quickly define new hands and tiers.</li>
            <li>9. Allow runs to be exported and shared based on an url.</li>
            <li>10. Support colors.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Change log:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2022-11-07: Started the page. Put in the basic calculation based on 1-card starters.</li> 
            <li>2022-11-09: Hosting site on github.</li>
