<i>This implements the underlying algorithm for calculating opening hand probabilities, a method I'm calling "Constrained Weak Composition".</i>

<p>A deck is represented by an array of numbers such as [3, 3, 3, 31], each element representing the number of copies of a card in the deck.
Let's call these cards A, B, C, and Blanks for now.
An "integer composition" for a hand of n cards is an array with the same number of elements with each element representing how many copies are drawn.
For example, [2, 1, 0, 2] represents 2A + 1B + 0C + 2Blanks.</p>

<p>We have a specialized version of integer composition problem because we have to support 0s as elements; drawing 5 cards out of 40 means many cards will show up at zero copies. Integer compositions with zeros are "weak".
Another caveat is that the maximum number copies of each card is "constrained" by the deck; if there only 3 copies of A in the deck, we can't allow compositions that lead with [4, ...].</p>

<p>Why use compositions?
Using compositions will trivialize calculating probabilities when combined with the next step.</p>

<p>Let's take 3 compositions of [3, 3, 3, 31] such as [2, 1, 0, 2], [3, 0, 2, 0] and [3, 0, 0, 2].
These are 3 distinct hands.</p>

<p>To do a probability calculation, we know the denominator is (40 choose 5) or exactly 658,008.</p>

<p>Using the copies in the deck represented by [3, 3, 3, 31], we know how many copies of each card we have to chooose from.
The composition represents how many of each card we are choosing.</p>

<p>So for [2, 1, 0, 2], the formula would be (3 choose 2) * (3 choose 1) * (3 choose 0) * (31 choose 2) = 4185.
The probability of that hand is 4185 / 658008 = 0.00636010504.</p>

<p>For illustrative purposes, I'll also calculate out [3, 0, 2, 0] vs [3, 0, 0, 2] to show the impact of having only 3 copies of C in the deck vs. 31 copies of Blanks.</p>

<p>(3 choose 2) * (3 choose 0) * (3 choose 2) * (31 choose 0) / (40 choose 5) = 0.00000455921.</p>
<p>(3 choose 2) * (3 choose 0) * (3 choose 0) * (31 choose 2) / (40 choose 5) = 0.00070667833.</p>

<p>By doing 2 separate combinatorics problems, this algorithm is able to give exact probabilities without simulation.</p>

<p>Let's say you want to calculate the probability of "3A + 2 of anything else".
We first generate all compositions the deck and then see which ones match that criteria of having 3As.
Then we just count the number of combinations, add them up, and divide by (40 choose 5).</p>

<p>For this specific example they would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>[3, 0, 0, 2] -> 465</li>
<li>[3, 0, 1, 1] -> 93</li>
<li>[3, 1, 0, 1] -> 93</li>
<li>[3, 0, 2, 0] -> 3</li>
<li>[3, 1, 1, 0] -> 9</li>
<li>[3, 2, 0, 0] -> 3</li>
</ul>

<p>sum = 465 + 93 + 93 + 3 + 9 + 3 = 666</p>
<p>probability = 666 / (40 choose 5) = 0.00101214574</p>

<p>Plugging this into a hyper geometric calculator such as <a href="https://www.yugioh.party/" target="_blank">https://www.yugioh.party/</a> gives the same answer of 0.10% for probability of opening all 3 copies of a single card.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this method is that you can check for multiple of hand patterns and account for their overlaps.
For example, your deck could have 1-card starters and 2-card combos.</p>

<p>Your "live" hand patterns could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>"1A + anything else" OR</li>
<li>"2Bs" OR</li>
<li>"1B + 1C"</li>
</ul>

<p>This type of problem would be impossible to solve with the usual hypergeometric calculator.</p>
<p>You could try to solve for this by drawing a tree but then you could easily make a mistake in the calculation; hands with "1A + anything else" will overlap with "2Bs".</p>

<p>This algorithm would first generate all the compositions and then filter them to keep anything that matches any of the patterns.</p>
<p>Then it would count the combinations of the valid compositions and add them up to get the exact probability.</p>
<p>This avoids doubling counting of compositions that match two patterns.</p>
<p>This idea can be further extended concepts of hand "tiers". Instead of just "live" vs. "brick", your hands could be "the nuts", "great", "ok", and "brick". Each of these tiers would have their own sets of hand patterns. For each composition, assign it to the highest tier based on matching hand patterns. Then add up the composition combination counts for each tier to show a probability. Deck ratios result in a distribution of probability outcomes. This allows changing deck ratios to find the tradeoffs on "ceiling" vs. "consistency".</p>
